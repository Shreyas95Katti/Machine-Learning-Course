Hello Guys!!

## Iris Data Visualization Project
The Iris Project is a data visualization project. It involves the most basic data visualization function. Being beginner freindly I would suggest my fellow Machine Learning enthusiasts to have a look at this. Data visualization is considered to be the first step into any machine learning problem statement. It allows you to view the positioning of the data points and thus hints you the best model for any given problem statement. The given project invloves concepts from two main python libraries Matplotlib and Seborn. It gives you an overview of the few main data visualization functions which are widely used namely: 1)PairPlot 2)Histogram 3)ViolinPlot 4)BoxPlot 5)ScatterMatrix 6)Heatmap

These plots will surely give you a clear cut idea about the model to be used in your machine learning project. It will familiarize you with the data visualizaton techniques!

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris

The dataset contains the following data about the Iris flower 1)ID 2)SepalLength(cm) 3)SepalWidth(cm) 4)PetalLength(cm) 5)PetalWidth(cm) 6)Species


## Boston House Price Prediction Project
The Boston house price prediction project is a highly intutive project. It allows you to explore basic and important machine learning concepts such as Data Visualization, Linear Regression and Robust Regreesion. These topics are the stepping stones to get into core machine learning projects. In the project we focus on single variable linear regression model. This is a supervised learning technique considering that we have a labeled dataset. The project starts with importing the required python libraries and and loading the dataset with appropriate changes. Then we visualize the dataset to observe the data points. This is done using two major data visualization techniques that are pairplot and heatmap. The next step involved is the usage of the linear regression model on the training and testing sub-dataset. We view how the linear regression predicts an accurate result by plotting the best fit curve which is done using the data visualization functions regplot and jointplot. The model is evaluated. Finally we repeat the same procedure for robust regression also. With the knowledge about this dataset we finish the project by visualizing how a perfect dataset and a perfect linear regression model look.

The major take away from this project is: Machine Learning is only 5 steps

1)Import required libraries

2)Choose a model and apply necessary parameters

3)Arrange data into feature matrix and target matrix

4)Fit model fo give data

5)Apply for new data
